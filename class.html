    <p>Hello There. So having a udemy course starting i am starting with the basic of using html elements like how to use html5, head,body,title(all open<> and close< />). So hence the first lesson officially with Udemy.</p>
	<p>And so we move on to explaining the use of paragraph tags which is the p tag that sections our body contents into individual paragraphs and makes them stand alone. </p>
	<p>Now we move on to other tags like the bolb/block tag that <b>bolds</b> whatever we have it attached to as seen above. Another example thus is <b>"making an entire statement or paragraph bold, as it does not apply only to just making words or letters bold."</b>
		<p id="sticky">So apperently we also have to put into consideration that at the time when these tags were first made we did not have as much tech as we do now like the type of phones we have now or laptops. So tags like bold as we've seen and italic <i>"which is this effect"</i> are not so used right now cause of advances. </p>
		<p>So now the new tags being used in place of the bold and italic tags are strong= <strong>"which is this for bold"</strong> and em= <em>"for in this case emphasies but stands in place of the italic "i" tag.</em> </p>
